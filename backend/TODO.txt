- subgraph service
- transaction-handler service
  - get transactions
    - save to DB
    - if a tx is unhandled 
- registration service
  - api to associate arbiter evm address with email address


- Email service for arbiters:
  - Arbiter owners can register an email
  - Poll subgraph from time to time to retrieve "new arbitration request" events. 
  - send emails using bel2.org or belayer2.org domains in zoho mail

- Pending questions:
  - on what UI page would you like arbiter owners to register their email address?
  - should we send emails to arbiter owners? operators? or both?
  - do you want the arbiter ownership to be verified first before accepting new email registration, to make sure not everyone can overwrite emails addresses, or we don't do that for now?
  - what kind of email would you like to send? only when there is an arbitration request? Or also for other events?
  - do you also want to use this service to send email to users who request compensations, for some kind of feedback?
