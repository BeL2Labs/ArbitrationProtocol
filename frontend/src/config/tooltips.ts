  arbiterFeeRate: "An arbiter charges a yearly fee, like 10%. If they stake 1000 ELA valued at 3 USD each, their annual fee is 300 USD. If a DApp selects them for 6 months, they get 150 USD. This fee is based on the ELA price at the selection time, ignoring future price changes.",
  revenueAddress: "EVM address, normally owned by arbiters, that receives tokens from dApps as compensation for arbiters service.",
  arbiterDeadline: "The deadline is set by the arbiter and refers to the period during which the arbiter commits to providing services. During this time, an arbiter cannot withdraw their stake if they are processing any dApp transactions, but they can if there is no work in progress. After this date, the arbiter becomes inactive. dApps that require longer periods for proof validation should not use arbiters with short-term expirations.",
  transactionIntro: "Transactions listed here are all transactions generated by dApps, and that potentially require protection from the arbitration mechanism. Only a few transactions from this list will actually receive arbitration requests, meaning work to be done by the arbiter they are attached to.",
  compensationIntro: "Compensations are requested by dApp users when they believe an arbiter has violated the terms of service, for example by submitting an invalid proof. If the arbiter fraud is confirmed, the dApp user is compensated by taking coins from the arbiter's stake.",
  dappIntro: "A dApp in the current context is any on chain contract that plans to require services from this arbitration service."
