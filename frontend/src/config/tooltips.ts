  arbiterFeeRate: "An arbiter charges a yearly fee, like 10%. If they stake 1000 ELA valued at 3 USD each, their annual fee is 300 USD. If a DApp selects them for 6 months, they get 150 USD. This fee is based on the ELA price at the selection time, ignoring future price changes.",
  revenueAddress: "EVM address, normally owned by arbiters, that receives tokens from dApps as compensation for arbiters service.",
  arbiterDeadline: "This deadline is defined by the arbiter and refers to the period during which the arbiter commits to providing its services. During this period, an arbiter is not able to withdraw his stake if it's processing some dApp transactions, but he can if there is no work in progress. After this date, the arbiter becomes inactive. dApps that require longer periods for their proofs validations don't use arbiters with too short term expirations."
