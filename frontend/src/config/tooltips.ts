  arbiterFeeRate: "An arbiter charges a yearly fee, like 10%. If the arbiter is stake 1000 ELA valued at 3 USD per ELA, the annual fee is 300 USD (fee is based on the ELA price at the selection time, ignoring future price changes). If a dApp selects this arbiter for 6 months, it gets charged 150 USD, no matter if an arbitration happens or not, and no matter what the value of the dApp contract represents. For instance, a loan dApp might use an arbiter that staked 3000 USD worth of coins, only for a loan of 10 usd - in this case the dApp is charged based on the 3000 usd value, not on 10 usd.",
  revenueAddress: "EVM address, normally owned by arbiters, that receives tokens from dApps as compensation for arbiters service.",
  arbiterDeadline: "The deadline is set by the arbiter and refers to the period during which the arbiter commits to providing services. During this time, an arbiter cannot withdraw their stake if they are processing any dApp transactions, but they can if there is no work in progress. After this date, the arbiter becomes inactive. dApps that require longer periods for proof validation should not use arbiters with short-term expirations.",
  transactionIntro: "Transactions listed here are all transactions generated by dApps, and that potentially require protection from the arbitration mechanism. Only a few transactions from this list will actually receive arbitration requests, meaning work to be done by the arbiter they are attached to.",
  compensationIntro: "Compensations are requested by dApp users when they believe an arbiter has violated the terms of service, for example by submitting an invalid proof. So basically, compensations are requests to punish arbiters for a bad behavior. If the arbiter fraud is confirmed, the dApp user is compensated by taking coins from the arbiter's stake.",
  dappIntro: "A dApp in the current context is any on chain contract that plans to require services from this arbitration service.",
  arbiterCoinStake: "The more an arbiter stakes, the larger the transaction values it can process. For example, if the arbiter is used for a lending dApp that needs to process a loan order of 100 USDT, it will be elected only if its staked amount is higher than that. Consequently, the fee the arbiter receives is also proportional to the staked amount."
