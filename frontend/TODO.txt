TO BE CLARIFIED FIRST:

- Email service for arbiters:
  - "Arbiter can register an email for the arbitration notification, we need a background script to check the events"
  - "new arbitration request" event. poll subgraph (better?) or listen to evm events.
  - need to create a backend
  - we already have bel2.org belayer2.org in zoho mail

P2:


------------------------------------------

P2 (blocked):

- Submit compensation request when transaction is completed = M8 error (no active).
    - button should not have been shown (See "How to show compensation request buttons" below)

- How to show compensation request buttons:
  Conditions:
  - claimIllegalSignatureCompensation：the dapp don't request arbitration, but the utxo is spent by alice and arbitrator.
  - claimFailedArbitrationCompensation: the dapp requested arbitration, and arbitrator submitted signature, but the transaction can not spend
  Details:
  - how to know if "dapp requested arbitration"? transaction status == "Arbitrated" ?
  - how to know a signature was submitted?
  - how to know the utxo is spent by alice? By the way, who is alice on the arbiter portal, i don't know alice?
  - how to know the transaction cannot spend?
    "only the dapp knows whether the transaction can spend or not. I think dapp should choose"
      => so the arbiter portal cannot decide to show buttons or not
  Answers (Aria):
  - status == active --> not request arbitration
  - status == arbitrated --> requested arbitration but signature not submitted
  - status == submitted --> signature submitted
  Answer (sjun):
  - always show the buttons, after arbitration
  BEN:
  - Unclear, we cannot just show all the buttons... need refinement after the releaase

------------------------------------------

P3:

- Bug: edit arbiter staking: reopen the dialog after a max stake red error: the "Stake value should be lower than 50 ELA. Now 72.5 ELA" is still displayed

- arbiter registration: hide "operator" (self by default)

- Ability to unregister dapp: 
  - TBD: from dapps list of from my dashboard?

- (zehua) There are some issues with how to obtain the InputIndex (for illegal signature compensation). 
    - In cases of evil, there may be multiple inputs. 
    - The correct way to determine the InputIndex is as follows:
        1. get the UTXO from the contract, which is a transaction hash (tx hash)
        2. check Utxo hash's position in the TxIn of the current BTC transaction which you want to call zkp verify
        3. If it’s the first input, the index is 0; if it’s the second input, the index is 1, and so on.
