------- AFTER DEC 30 RELEASE ------

- transactions list submit signature: should check if the current btc address is the same as the arbiter operator or transaction one?

P2:
- Bug: edit arbiter staking: reopen the dialog after a max stake red error: the "Stake value should be lower than 50 ELA. Now 72.5 ELA" is still displayed
- arbiter registration: hide "operator" (self by default)
- "Install Metamask" should look like a real button
- Transaction list still seems to reload every time the page is entered.
- @benjaminpiette user cannot know the public key of the unisat btc wallet, maybe we should add "Import " button here?
  - (in edit arbiter dialog)
- Add a footer:
      BeL2 Website
      BeL2 github
      BeL2 twitter
      BeL2 lending app
      Elastos website (Elastos.info)

- Transaction list:
  - Submit arbitration:
    - There is a data that need to be signed, you should call the wallet to sign it
    - Pending feature completion by xiaobin

- Finish to replace headless UI components with https://ui.shadcn.com/
  - Compensation details dialog

- Email service for arbiters:
  - "Arbiter can register an email for the arbitration notification, we need a background script to check the events"
  - "new arbitration request" event. poll subgraph (better?) or listen to evm events.
  - need to create a backend
  - we already have bel2.org belayer2.org in zoho mail

- Ability to unregister dapp: 
  - TBD: from dapps list of from my dashboard?

- Subgraph sucks! (backward compatibility in case of event change, missing params in events, inability to call methods...).
  - We should consider using subgraph only to LIST items (arbiters, transactions) but with minimal information,
    for example information we need for search queries (pagination, search tx id...)
  - Everything else should be handled by multicalls from the client app.
