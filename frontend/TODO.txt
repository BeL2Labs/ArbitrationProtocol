===> Target release date: dec 30

- bug: register arbitrator, operator seems null, and dashboard shows nothing
- forbid "register arbitrator" buttons/page if arbitrator already owned

- transaction list
  - format table values
  - refresh icon next to title to get latest transactions
- arbitrator list:
  - remember previous view mode in local storage
  - list view: show a opearator column (evm, btc addr, btc pub key), possibly foldable
  - grid view: group operato values together
- arbitrator dashboard
  - finalize arbitrator preview with well formatted data
  - ability to edit value + write to contract
  - wait for contract new register() method that will merge oeprator/revenue/params in one call
    - registers sets all fields at once. But updating later should call individual methods
  - Button to "edit stake":
    - Share the same (customizable) component as for "register arbitrator"
    - Change "register" to "stake"
    - Ability to unstake
    - Show current stake summary (hideable)
- Arbitrator registration (incl staking)
  - register with NFT
  
- Mobile view: header menu is broken

P2:
- status label component with bg color like for arbitrators, everywhere (dapps list, etc)
- Try zustand for state management instead of rxjs
- Handle subgraph api errors, forward to hooks and pages
- Finish to replace headless UI components with https://ui.shadcn.com/
- register dapp: intro about what a dapp is
